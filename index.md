### Course description

This is a fairly rigorous introduction to probability theory with some emphasis given to both theory and applications, although a knowledge of measure theory is not assumed. Topics covered are: probability spaces, conditional probability, discrete and continuous random variables, generating functions, characteristic functions, random walks, branching processes, limit theorems.

### Prerequisites

Math 451 required.

### Textbook

(Optional) Walsh, John B. Knowing the odds: an introduction to probability. Vol. 139. American Mathematical Soc., 2012.

### Grading

The grading scheme is as follows:

* Assignments: 20%
* Midterms: 40%
* Final: 40%

The lowest of your assignment scores will not count towards your final grade. Midterms will be held in class. The final is on **April 23rd, 1:30 - 3:30 pm** (room TBA).

Grades will be posted on Canvas:

## Miscellany

You are not expected to know any material in this section for assignments/exams.

* It was asked in class if the [principle of inclusion-exclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle) can be extended to countably many events. The answer seems to be yes, but with some technical conditions. See, e.g., [Friedland, Shmuel, and Elliot Krop. "Exact conditions for countable inclusion-exclusion identity and extensions."](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0602035)
